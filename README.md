# I-Bar Prototype Design and Analysis
- Design and Modeling: Created a bar prototype using SolidWorks as part of a DOME course under Prof. Tejas Prakash.
	- Simulation and Analysis:Analyzed and meshed the model in ANSYS to evaluate its structural integrity.
	- Advanced Techniques: Applied deep learning methods to predict the factor of safety, stress-strain life of the bar, integrating modern analytical techniques with traditional engineering practices.
